# Thundergeddon

## What is Thundergeddon?

**Thundergeddon** is a hybrid tabletop/RC tank battle game: real, small robotic tanks fight in the physical world, while a **Unity companion app** runs the match logic and controls the robots over the local network.

* **Physical side:**
  
  * Custom ESP32 electronics, motor + turret control, and an IR “shooting / hit detection” system plus FPV camera streaming
  
  * Robots measure about 13cm long, 8cm wide and 8cm high
  * Robots body is 3d printed PLA, created in OnShape
  * Electronics designed in KiCad, manufactured by JLC PCB
  
* **Digital side (Unity app):** discovers/hosts robots on Wi-Fi (UDP discovery + WebSocket control), lets you select and drive a tank with an on-screen joystick, shows a live video feed per robot, and runs **turn-based rules** like player/alliance turns, action points, and a coordinated “shoot” sequence.

## To-do

V0.2

- [ ] Test reverse polarity protection
- [x] Add hull board LED on spare GPIO

V0.3

- [ ] Maybe: Stable voltage for motors
- [ ] Maybe: NFC reader



## Hardware

I have designed two boards: hull and turret.  Both boards are standard 2-sided, default JLC PCB boards.  The hull will have two sided assembly, while the turret will only be assembled on the top side.  Both boards have a GND pour on the bottom layer.  

Each board is a separate KiCad file.  

------

### Hull Board

The hull board connects to the battery, motors, IR receivers and turret board via a slip-ring.

#### **Power**

Two 18350 li-ion batteries power the robot

* 2S Pack (7.4V nominal)
* Connected via a JST XH 2-pin connector (J2 C158012)
* Positive terminal connected to Q1 source pin via 1.2mm width copper trace
* Negative connects to GND

#### **Reverse Polarity Protection**

I use a P-channel MOSFET to protect the board from reversed batteries (Q1 C15127)

+ **Drain** (pad 3) connects to J2 (from battery)

- **Source**  (pad 2) connects to C15 via 1.2mm width copper trace (to +BATT  and robot components)
- **Gate** (pad 1) connects to GND via inline 100kΩ resistor (R4 C25803)
- Source and drain both have an an area of copper under them around 5mm×5mm with several vias to a similar size area on the other side of the board

#### **Bulk Capacitor**

I'm using a 220uF bulk capacitor (C15 C2887273). 

* Anode connects to:
  * Q1 Drain
  * +BATT
    * PS1 EN and IN
    * U2 and U3 VM 
    * Slip Ring
* Cathode connects to GND

#### 3.3V Voltage Step-down

* Step down regulator SY8113BADC (PS1 C78989)
* EN and IN connect to C15 with a 10uF decoupling capacitor to GND (C10 C15850)
* FB connects to:
  * 22kΩ to GND (R16 C31850)
  * 100kΩ (to +3V3_HULL with 22pF in parallel (C14 C1653)
* GND connected to GND
* BS connects to 100nf (C13 C14663) inline to LX
* LX connects
  * to 4.7uH inductor (L1 C167220)
  * Two decoupling capacitors 100nf (C7 C14663) and 47uF (C9 C16780)
  * Out to +3V3_HULL

#### I2C Expander

PCA9555PW is used to provide GPIOs for motor control and IR receivers (U8 C128392).  

* SCL and SDA connect to slip ring (pull ups are on the turret board)
* INT no connection
* A0, A1, A2 connect to GND
* VSS to GND

| IO   | Connects to            | Pull up to +3V3_HULL |
| ---- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| 0_0  | IR Receive N           | 10kΩ (R8 C25804)     |
| 0_1  | IR Receive NE          | 10kΩ (R9 C25804)     |

| 0_6  | IR Receive W           | 10kΩ (R11 C25804)    |
| 0_7  | IR Receive NW          | 10kΩ (R10 C25804)    |
| 1_0  | Left Motor Control 1   | n/a                  |
| 1_1  | Left Motor Control 2   | n/a                  |
| 1_2  | Turret Motor Control 1 | n/a                  |
| 1_3  | Turret Motor Control 2 | n/a                  |
| 1_4  | Motors Sleep           | n/a                  |
| 1_5  | Right Motor Control 2  | n/a                  |
| 1_6  | Right Motor Control 1  | n/a                  |
| 1_7  | LED                    | n/a                  |

The LED (D4 C2297) on 1_7 will enable testing the PCA9555 and has an inline 220Ω (R28 C22962).  

I have decided not to use the INT connection as it would mean an additional wire going through the slip ring.  I'll see if I can get away without using it.

The +3V3 connection on the ESP32 is decoupled with two capacitors, 10uF (C28 C15850) and 100nF (C27 C14663).  

##### Buttons

There are buttons on EN  and BOOT.  I chose to include buttons so that I can force the ESP32 into programming mode if required.  I hope that I won't need to press the buttons and just program via USB_D+ and USB_D-.  

###### EN Button

The EN switch (SW2 C318884) is connected on one side to GND and the other side to EN on the ESP32.  Between the switch and EN there is a 1uF capacitor (C23 C15849) to GND and a 10k resistor (R16 C25804) to +3V3.  

###### BOOT button

The BOOT switch (SW1 C318884) is connected on one side to GND and the other side to GPIO00/BOOT on the ESP32.  Between the switch and GPIO0 there is a 10k resistor (R15 C25804) to +3V3.  

##### I2C

SDA and SCL are both pulled high with 4.7kΩ resistors (SDA R19, SCL R20 C23162).  They both have 33Ω inline resistors (SDA R21, SCL R22 C23140).  

##### INT

INT connects from GPIO14 to INT on the PCA9555PW on the hull via the Slip Ring.  The line is pulled high with a 4.7k (R25 C23162)

#### Camera Connector

I am to connect an OV2640 camera module via the camera connector (FPC1 C262643). The camera is fed from 3V3_CLEAN which is converted to 2.8V and 1.3V power rails.

#### USB Connector

USB-C connector (J2 C165948) for reprogramming the ESP32.  

| Pin  | Connected to |
| ---- | ------------ |
| VBUS | +5V_USB      |
| SBU2 | NC           |
| CC1  | GND          |

| CC2  | GND          |
| VBUS | +5V_USB      |
| EH   | GND          |

* CC1: connected to GND through 5.1 kΩ (R2 C23186) 

  CC2: connected to GND through 5.1 kΩ  (R1 C23186) 

* VBUS

  * 100nF (C1 C14663) and 10uF (C2 C15850) decoupling capacitors
  * Schottky diode (D1 C8598) to prevent power flow from +BATT into USB connection.
  * Schottky diode is oriented +5V_USB → Anode → Schottky Diode → Cathode → +BATT
  * I have found in testing that the USB is powerful enough to drive the motors, so I'm not worried about USB back powering the whole +BATT net.  

* USB Data

  * Data lines USB_D+ and USB_D- are a differential pair

  * ESD protection diode (D2 C5180302) wired as follows:

    | ESD protection diode PRTR5V0U2X pin | Connection | Decoupling         |
    | ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
    | I/01                                | USB_D-     |                    |
    | I/02                                | USB_D+     |                    |

  * There are two 22Ω series resistors on the D+ (R24 C25092) and D- (R23 C25092) lines.  

* I will only be using the USB connection for programming the ESP32 at first, then switch to OTA programming.  I will not be running the motors while on USB power.  I am aware that D1 will reduce the voltage potentially as low as 4.5V which may be marginal for the SY8113B input.  I will take that risk to keep things simple.  

#### Slip Ring Connector

Right angle JST PH 5 pin connector (J1 C157923) allows for connection to the hull board via the slip ring.  

#### IR LEDs

Two external 3mm through-hole 940nm IR leds will be soldered manually via ~10mm wires/or legs.  The 2.54mm 1×02 pin headers are DNP as I am just using the through holes to solder wires.

#### External RGB LED

Six external WS2812B LEDs will be soldered manually via ~30mm wires.  The 2.54mm 1×03 pin header connector (J6) is DNP as I am just using the through holes to solder wires.  

The three pins connect to +3V3, GPIO38 and GND

I have four decoupling capacitors on +3V3:

* 3 × 22uF (C29, C24, C18 C45783)
* 1 × 100nf (C25 C14663)

I have one 330Ω inline resistor (R14 C23138) on GPIO38.  

The WS2812B require 5V, however I have tested the LEDs at 3.3V and they appear to work perfectly well with an excellent level of brightness.  

#### Buzzer

An external 3V piezo buzzer (not inductive/magnetic) will be soldered manually via ~30mm wires.  The  The 2.54mm 1×02 pin header (J3) is DNP as I am just using the through holes to solder wires.  

The two pins are connected to +3V3 and a MMBT3904 transistor (Q1 C20526).  

The transistor pins are connected as follows:

| MMBT3904 Pin |           |       |
| ------------ | --------- | ----- |
| 1            | Base      | GPIO1 |
| 2            | Emitter   | GND   |
| 3            | Collector | J3    |

The connection to GPIO1 has an inline 1KΩ resistor (R8 C21190) and is pulled low with a 100kΩ resistor (R9 C25803)

#### Status LEDs

I have a red LED (D3 C2286) to show battery power. 
+BATT → Inline 10kΩ (R17 C25804) → Anode → LED → Cathode → GND

I have a green LED (D4 C2297) to control from GPIO48.  
+3V3 → Inline 1kΩ (R18 C21190) → Anode → LED → Cathode → GPIO48

#### Antenna

I will connect an external antenna via the IPX connector on the ESP32.
